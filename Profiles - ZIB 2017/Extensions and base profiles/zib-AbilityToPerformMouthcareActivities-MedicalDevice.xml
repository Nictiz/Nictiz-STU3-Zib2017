  <description value="A MedicalDevice resource as defined by the Dutch Health and Care Information models (Dutch: Zorginformatiebouwsteen or ZIB) AbilityToPerformMouthcareActivities v3.1(2017EN).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The ability to perform mouthcare activities is part of self-care. This includes brushing teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and/or cleaning (partial) dentures, cleaning jaws without teeth (edentulous jaws) and taking care of the mucous membrane of the mouth.&#xD;&#xA;Limitations in this ability indicate a reduced ability to cope for oneself.&#xD;&#xA;This activity and activities such as those including eating, getting dressed and bathing are also known as activities of daily living (ADL). These are the activities people go through in daily life. The extent to which a person is able to do all these activities by themselves is a measure for their total ability to do things independently.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Source: Instruction card for oral hygiene, 2011)" />
  <purpose value="# Purpose of HCIM&#xD;&#xA;Problems with oral health can lead to malnutrition or disease: if the patient has difficulty eating, insufficient nutrients are absorbed. A bad set of teeth can also have negative social consequences, such as no longer being able to talk properly, having bad breath or a patient being embarrassed because of their appearance.&#xD;&#xA;Information on limitations in a patient’s ability to keep up their own dental hygiene is important in determining the nature and intensity of the care the patient needs. In a transfer situation, it offers the receiving organization the ability to anticipate the intensity of the care to be given to the patient, enabling continuity in healthcare for the patient.&#xD;&#xA;If policy has been implemented to improve a patient’s ability to do things independently, the entered extent of independence helps to evaluate the efficiency of the treatment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Purpose of this profile&#xD;&#xA;This profile complements the Observation resource zib-AbilityToPerformMouthcareActivities with information about prostheses used. The actual prostheses are references to the resource zib-AbilityToPerformMouthcareActivities-MedicalDeviceProduct." />
