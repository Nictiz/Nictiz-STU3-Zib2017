  <description value="Contact as defined by the Dutch General Practitioners Association (Nederlands Huisartsengenootschap or NHG) based on the Dutch Health and Care Information models (Dutch: Zorginformatiebouwsteen or ZIB) version 1.0.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A contact is any interaction, regardless of the situation, between a patient and the healthcare provider, in which the healthcare provider has primary responsibility for diagnosing, evaluating and treating the patientâ€™s condition and informing the patient. These can be visits, appointments or non face-to-face interactions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A general practitioner encounter could be used to discuss multiple 'episodes'. Based on the axis op 'episode', one FHIR Encounter (Dutch: 'consult' or 'contactmoment') there will be multiple virtual partial encounters (Dutch: 'deelcontact'). The FHIR Encounter is always about the whole encounter spanning everything that was discussed, regardless of the number of 'episodes'. This profile only deals with past contacts. Future contacts can be documented in the PlannedCareActivity information model." />

      <definition value="The start and end time of the encounter. When all that is known is a single value for an Encounter that already took place, both `Period.start` and `Period.end` should be populated with this (same) value (populating just `Period.start` would indicate an Encounter that started at the given value but hasn't ended). See comment for more background." />
      <comment value="If not (yet) known, `Period.end` may be omitted. While a general practitioner (GP) encounter generally is a ten minute consultation, most GP systems will only export the date. Some systems will actually export the ten minute consultation as expected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In FHIR STU3 and R4, the Period datatype has an invariant that inconsistently in text states that `Period.start` shall be lower than `Period.end`, but actually supports lower than *or equal to* in its expression, which reflects the original intent. This has been fixed for FHIR R5 so the text now reflects the expression. This means that, for GP systems that only have a date, both `Period.start` and `Period.end` should be populated with the same date. See [MM-1453](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/MM-1453) and [FHIR-28621](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-28621) that discuss this issue." />
