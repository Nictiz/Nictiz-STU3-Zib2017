# Medication Process 9.0.7 examples
This folder contains examples conform Medication Process 9.0.7 and are added as part of [MM-1685](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/MM-1685). 

These generated example files are placed in a separate folder because they do not completely adhere to the filename and resource.id convention of the /example folder. [MM-1752](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/MM-1752) will harmonize the convention between the different repositories (e.g 'HL7-mappings', 'Nictiz-STU3-testscripts' and 'Nictiz-STU3-Zib2017').
